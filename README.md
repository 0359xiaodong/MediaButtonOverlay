Notes
-----

Project built in Android Studio. You should just be able to open the project from there. 

Omitted is an XML file in res/values called sensitive.xml. This is for the In-App Billing part, which handles a donation. It contains two strings: license\_key and donation\_sku. These should be relatively straightforward to add.
