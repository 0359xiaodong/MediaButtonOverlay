The latest release has made it significantly easier to add a player or a skin.

### Player

Extend the `MediaPlayer` class, included in the base directory, and put it in the `players` package. Then, just add the name of the player to `players_strings` and the class name to `players_classes` in the `players.xml` value file.

To allow for the button to change properly with play status, when calling the parent constructor, pass the needed `BroadcastReceiver` and `IntentFilter`.

To allow the player to start with the overlay, make sure to set `playerPackage` to the package ID of the player you want to start.

### Skin
 
Create an XML layout file. Make sure the buttons have the ID of `btnPrevious`, `btnPlayPause`, and `btnNext`, for those you want to implement. Then, add the skin name to `skins_names` and the layout resource name to `skins_resources` in the `skins.xml` value file.

To allow the orientation of the layout to change (assuming a `LinearLayout`), make sure the enclosing layout has the ID `buttonLayout`.

To allow the element to be recoloured, make sure the element is tagged "recolourable". If any additional processing needs to be done for your recolour, look at `MediaOverlayView.java` in the `setColour()` method.
